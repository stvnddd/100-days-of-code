# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Wednesday 22th June 2022

**Today's Progress**
Restarted _Responsive Web Design_ certification on freecodecamp.com. I went from scratch and reached Step 56 of initial project _Learn HTML by Building a Cat App_

**Time Spent**
1hr

**Thoughts**
I was already familiar with the basics of this but always good to refresh. I started from scratch because they have released a new curriculum so it seemed worth it to go back through it again after a long hiatus.

**Today's Progress**
Completed _CatPhotoApp_ project. Moved onto next project, _Building a Cafe Menu_. Completed that too at the end of session today.

**Time Spent** 1hr 30mins

**Thoughts**
Very satisfying seeing all the progress made after first and second basic projects. A sense of completion... even if this is the basic bare bones of learning HTML and CSS. Great seeing the fruits of ones labour.

**Today's Progress**
Continued onto new Project _CSS Color Markers_, on Step 54. Had fun learning about rgb values, hexadecimals, hls and linear-gradient functions.

**Time Spent** 30 mins (did extra 30 mins yesterday)

**Thoughts**
Playing with colours is lots of fun, I can imagine many a rabbit-hole trying to create perfect colour schemes for a future website design. I know many of them are pre-made but still, making one would be fun.

**Today's Progress**
Completed CSS Color Markers project. Fun learning about various color properties and box-shadow. Progressed onto the Registration Form project and completed that too. Started on the Survey Form project.

**Time Spent** 2hrs 30 mins

**Thoughts**
Now I have to do my own project, it will be a sure test as to how much I've absorbed. Although no one would be expected to memorise everything. At least it's all about having a methodical mindset, and doing things once at a time, avoiding the overwhelm when seeing so much code staring at me on the screen. It should be fun. I wonder how long it will take. Depends on how much I want to customise everything I suppose.

### Wednesday 29th June - Friday 1st July 2022

**Today's Progress**
Spent three days on my Project to create a survey form. Inspected the html/css of the example site, and copied a lot of CSS over, also spent (or wasted) time trying to find animation queries but I don't fully understand them yet and was competing above my weight, to borrow a fighting analogy.

**Time Spent**
Maybe around 5-6 hours over three days.

**Thoughts**
I enjoyed it but got myself a little frustrated due to lack of knowledge, general competency. I need to keep going and keep getting more experience before moving onto more advanced areas. I managed to do the basics of the project well with html, but i was a little lost on the CSS part. It will improve over time.

### Monday 4th July 2022

**Today's Progress**
Started and finished CSS Flexbox photo gallery section. Moved onto "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label".

**Time Spent**
2 hrs

**Thoughts**
It is going well. Struggling with consistency, mind is in a thousand places at once.
