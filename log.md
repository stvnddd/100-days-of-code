# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Wednesday 20th June 2022

**Today's Progress**
Restarted _Responsive Web Design_ certification on freecodecamp.com. I went from scratch and reached Step 56 of initial project _Learn HTML by Building a Cat App_

**Time Spent**
1hr

**Thoughts**
I was already familiar with the basics of this but always good to refresh. I started from scratch because they have released a new curriculum so it seemed worth it to go back through it again after a long hiatus.

**Today's Progress**
Completed _CatPhotoApp_ project. Moved onto next project, _Building a Cafe Menu_. Completed that too at the end of session today.

**Time Spent** 1hr 30mins

**Thoughts**
Very satisfying seeing all the progress made after first and second basic projects. A sense of completion... even if this is the basic bare bones of learning HTML and CSS. Great seeing the fruits of ones labour.
