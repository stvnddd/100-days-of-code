# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Wednesday 20th June 2022

**Today's Progress**
Restarted _Responsive Web Design_ certification on freecodecamp.com. I went from scratch and reached Step 56 of initial project _Learn HTML by Building a Cat App_

**Time Spent**
1hr

**Thoughts**
I was already familiar with the basics of this but always good to refresh. I started from scratch because they have released a new curriculum so it seemed worth it to go back through it again after a long hiatus.
