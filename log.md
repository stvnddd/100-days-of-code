# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday 24th September

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some basic html & html5 - just getting started. I'll be following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, from the beginning.

**Time Spent** 1 hr

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to learn more! I've literally just scratched the surface of the surface. I did one hour and it felt great to begin a new challenge.

### Day 2: Saturday 25th September

**Today's Progress**: I finished off basic HTML & HTML5 coding section and started on some CSS.

**Time Spent** 1hr 5m

**Thoughts** I'm just playing with the basics to begin with, once I get more involved I might specialise my coding path and find a narrower field of focus. Perhaps I'll focus on Python or SQL or something, I'm not sure what it is I'm aiming for yet.
