# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Wednesday 22th June 2022

**Today's Progress**
Restarted _Responsive Web Design_ certification on freecodecamp.com. I went from scratch and reached Step 56 of initial project _Learn HTML by Building a Cat App_

**Time Spent**
1hr

**Thoughts**
I was already familiar with the basics of this but always good to refresh. I started from scratch because they have released a new curriculum so it seemed worth it to go back through it again after a long hiatus.

**Today's Progress**
Completed _CatPhotoApp_ project. Moved onto next project, _Building a Cafe Menu_. Completed that too at the end of session today.

**Time Spent** 1hr 30mins

**Thoughts**
Very satisfying seeing all the progress made after first and second basic projects. A sense of completion... even if this is the basic bare bones of learning HTML and CSS. Great seeing the fruits of ones labour.

**Today's Progress**
Continued onto new Project _CSS Color Markers_, on Step 54. Had fun learning about rgb values, hexadecimals, hls and linear-gradient functions.

**Time Spent** 30 mins (did extra 30 mins yesterday)

**Thoughts**
Playing with colours is lots of fun, I can imagine many a rabbit-hole trying to create perfect colour schemes for a future website design. I know many of them are pre-made but still, making one would be fun.

**Today's Progress**
Completed CSS Color Markers project. Fun learning about various color properties and box-shadow. Progressed onto the Registration Form project and completed that too. Started on the Survey Form project.

**Time Spent** 2hrs 30 mins

**Thoughts**
Now I have to do my own project, it will be a sure test as to how much I've absorbed. Although no one would be expected to memorise everything. At least it's all about having a methodical mindset, and doing things once at a time, avoiding the overwhelm when seeing so much code staring at me on the screen. It should be fun. I wonder how long it will take. Depends on how much I want to customise everything I suppose.
