# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday 24th September

**Today's Progress** Worked on some basic html & html5 - just getting started. I'll be following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, from the beginning.

**Time Spent** 1 hr

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to learn more! I've literally just scratched the surface of the surface. I did one hour and it felt great to begin a new challenge.

### Day 2: Saturday 25th September

**Today's Progress** I finished off basic HTML & HTML5 coding section and started on some CSS.

**Time Spent** 1hr 5m

**Thoughts** I'm just playing with the basics to begin with, once I get more involved I might specialise my coding path and find a narrower field of focus. Perhaps I'll focus on Python or SQL or something, I'm not sure what it is I'm aiming for yet.

### Day 3: Sunday 26th September

**Today's Progress** Some basic html & CSS. Margins, padding then taking a cursory look at hexadecimals in RGB and which colours are most used and how to input them on a basic webpage. It’s baby steps but it’s still fun at this stage.

**Time Spent** 1h 5m

**Thoughts** Today was fun! Especially haxadecimals, always wanted to learn how the hex codes operate.

### Day 4: Monday 27th September

**Today's Progress** Completed Basic CSS, began Applied Visual Design module. Learned how to use u/em/s/strong tags, + box-shadow.

**Time Spent** 1h 5m

**Thoughts** Enjoyable, like yesterday. Colours and styling pages is good general knowledge. I did have second thoughts today about moving across to another course entirely. I might spend until Day 7 or so on <em>Responsive Web Design</em> but perhaps after I'll trial another module. I like the sound of <em>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, Front End Development Libraries Certification, Back- End Development and APIs Certification, & Information Security</em>. I'd like to start on some of those too.

### Day 5: Tuesday 28th September

**Today's Progress** Continued with visual design. Played with positioning, complementary colors, hues, tones and linear gradients.

**Time Spent** 1h

**Thoughts** It sparked some design ambitions within whilst playing with the colours, which I expanded on in my blog tonight.

### Day 6: Wednesday 29th September

**Today's Progress** Creating shapes using CSS, a moon & heart. Then looked at @keyframes and animation.

**Time Spent** 1h (split throughout day, considerable time constraints)

**Thoughts** I looked over the course curriculum on freeCodeCamp and they recommend a specific order to the modules/certificates. I may follow their advice - but if a job opportunity arises in the meantime, I can skip across to another topic. It is fun doing this stuff.

### Thursday 30th September

**Today's Progress** Learned <b>animation-timing-name/timing/function</b> - bezier curves, using <b>cubic-bezier</b> to create simple graphics. Completed Applied Visual Design, started on Applied Accessibility. Finished today learning about audio elements in HTML5.

**Time Spent** 1h

**Thoughts** It is difficult managing other responsibilities alongside the coding challenge, I'm taking on a heavy burden. But without that pressure to press on and excel my potential and focus on subjects that will help build my skillset, then I'll go loosey-goosey once again and wither away. It might be too much, but it's better than too little. I'm still enjoying the process. The more I practice coding and getting used to that world, the more my skills improve. Even my typing is becoming slightly more efficient - I should start a typing course, and go down the rabbit-hole of keyboard layouts... perhaps another time! Or very soon...
