# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday 24th September

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some basic html & html5 - just getting started. I'll be following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, from the beginning.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to learn more! I've literally just scratched the surface of the surface. I did one hour and it felt great to begin a new challenge.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
